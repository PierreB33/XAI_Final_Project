# XAI_Final_Project


# Generative AI Usage Statement

We used Generative AI (LLM-based assistants) in the following ways for this project:

- System design: drafted and refined the unified architecture (FastAPI backend, TensorFlow/PyTorch pipelines, React/Vite frontend) with AI suggestions, then validated choices within the team.
- Code drafting: generated initial versions of many functions and modules (both audio and image flows), followed by human review, debugging, and testing before integration; some functions were written manually.
- Documentation: produced the first draft of the technical review using AI, then performed human corrections and adjustments.
- Guidance: consulted AI for next-step decisions and option trade-offs throughout development; final implementation choices were made by the team.

All AI-assisted outputs were reviewed and adjusted by the team before inclusion in the submission.
